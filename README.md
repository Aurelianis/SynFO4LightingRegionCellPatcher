# Synthesis Fallout 4 Lighting & Region Cell Patcher

This patcher will forward Region and Lighting info in cell headers for the following mods (you don't have to have all of them for this to work):

Ultra Interior Lighting https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/22101

Clarity - A Visual Overhaul https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/31991

See region names on your save files - https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/41361

JSRS Sound Mod for Fallout 4 (Optional Regions file) - https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/52931

Diamond City Ambience - https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/39267

David Hunter - A Brotherhood Story (A couple of lighting entries and encounter zones are forwarded) - https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/16808

It will also keep the previsibines from PRP and any patches as long as your load order is correct. 

NOTE: Synthesis does not support the Compressed flag on cell records. I've included SetCompressedFlagOnCells.pas which is an xEdit script that will flag them.
